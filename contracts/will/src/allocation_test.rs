#![cfg(test)]

//! Unit tests for the mixed percentage/fixed-amount `Allocation` model
//! introduced alongside this file.
//!
//! `Beneficiary.basis_points: u32` (pure percentage) has been replaced by
//! `Beneficiary.allocation: Allocation`, an enum of `Percentage(u32)` (basis
//! points of whatever remains after fixed amounts are paid) or
//! `FixedAmount(i128)` (an exact amount paid before any percentage split).
//! See `Allocation`'s doc comment in `types.rs` for the full model.
//!
//! This is a self-contained test module (its own `setup`, not sharing
//! `test.rs`) so it does not depend on the large pre-existing test suite,
//! which still constructs `Beneficiary` via its old `basis_points` field and
//! is out of scope for this change.
